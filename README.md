This Python program is designed to split a large file into smaller chunks while adding a custom header at the beginning of each split file. The header includes promotional ASCII art and support information. Here's a detailed breakdown to help you document it on your GitHub repository:

# Overview
This script splits a file into smaller parts, each with a specified size in megabytes (MB). It adds a custom header containing ASCII art and promotional text at the start of each split file. This can be useful for distributing large files while maintaining branding or attribution in each part.

# Features
Splits a large file into smaller chunks based on user-specified size (in MB).
Adds a custom header with ASCII art and promotional text to each split file.
Names the split files with the original file name followed by _part1, _part2, etc.
Handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-existent file paths or non-integer chunk sizes.
How It Works
1. Getting User Input
The script prompts the user to:

Enter the path of the file they want to split.
Specify the chunk size in megabytes (MB).
python
Copy
Edit
file_path = input("Enter the path of the text file to split: ")
chunk_size_mb = int(input("Enter the size (in MB) to split the file: "))
2. Validating Input
Checks if the file path exists using os.path.isfile().
Ensures the chunk size is a positive integer.
python
Copy
Edit
if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
    print("File does not exist. Please check the path.")
    return
if chunk_size_mb <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer for the size.")
    return
3. Splitting the File
The file is read in binary mode (rb) to handle any type of file (e.g., text, images, videos).
It splits the file into chunks of the specified size by reading a portion of the file and saving it to a new file.
The new file names are in the format: originalfilename_part1.extension, originalfilename_part2.extension, etc.
python
Copy
Edit
chunk_size = chunk_size_mb * 1024 * 1024  # Convert MB to bytes
new_file_name = f"{base_file_name}_part{part_num}{file_extension}"
with open(new_file_name, 'wb') as chunk_file:
    chunk_file.write(header_text.encode('utf-8'))
    chunk_file.write(chunk)
4. Adding a Custom Header
Each split file starts with a custom header containing ASCII art and promotional text. This is hardcoded in the header_text variable:

python
Copy
Edit
header_text = """
╔════════════════════════════════╗
║  https://t.me/wizardsdatabase  ║
...
╚════════════════════════════╝
"""
5. Incrementing File Parts
The variable part_num keeps track of the file part number, ensuring each split file is uniquely named.

python
Copy
Edit
part_num = 1
new_file_name = f"{base_file_name}_part{part_num}{file_extension}"
part_num += 1
6. End of File Check
The loop terminates once the entire file is read:

python
Copy
Edit
if not chunk:  # End of file
    break
Example
Assume you have a file named largefile.txt that is 100 MB in size. If you set the chunk size to 25 MB, the script will:

Create four files:
largefile_part1.txt
largefile_part2.txt
largefile_part3.txt
largefile_part4.txt
Add the custom header at the beginning of each split file.
Display a success message for each created file:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Created: largefile_part1.txt
Created: largefile_part2.txt
Created: largefile_part3.txt
Created: largefile_part4.txt
Dependencies
This script uses the built-in Python os module. It does not require any external libraries, making it easy to run in any standard Python environment.

python
Copy
Edit
import os
How to Run the Script
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Save the script as file_splitter.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using:
bash
Copy
Edit
python file_splitter.py
Possible Improvements
Progress Indicator: Add a progress bar to show file splitting progress.
Customizable Header: Allow users to input their own header text.
Error Handling: Enhance error handling for permission issues or read/write errors.
